# log-analyzer-practice
Learned about log analysis tools and wanted to give it a try, this tool Parses common web/server logs (Apache/Nginx Common/Combined log format). Runs rule based detections for suspicious activity (brute force login, SQLi/XSS patterns, scanning, suspicious user agents, high request rates). Produces human-readable alerts + JSON/CSV reports.
